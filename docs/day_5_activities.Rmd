## Task 1
One established way to calculate the volume of stormwater expected for a watershed (necessary to design best management practices & systems) is the Simple Method, which involves two steps. First, the runoff coefficient Rv
(storm runoff / storm rainfall) is calculated from: $Rv=0.05+0.9∗I$
 
Where Rv is the runoff coefficient (unitless), and I is the fraction of the watershed that is considered “impervious” (unitless). The volume of stormwater that needs to be handled, V in cubic feet, is then calculated by: $V=3630∗Rd∗Rv∗A$
Where Rd is the “design storm rainfall depth” in inches, usually set to 1.0 or 1.5, Rv is the runoff coefficient calculated above, and A is the watershed area.
